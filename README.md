## [SubGIT]

SubGit is a tool for a smooth, stress-free SVN to Git migration. Create a writable Git mirror of a local or remote Subversion repository and use both Subversion and Git as long as you like. You may also do a fast one-time import from Subversion to Git or use SubGit within Atlassian Bitbucket Server.
